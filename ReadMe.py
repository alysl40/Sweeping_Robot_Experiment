These three files divide spaces into different shapes and to explore which shapes robot performances best.


Experiment 2: Compare the robot's efficiency between takeing out the garbage first and go to charger first.

#Priority.py   This file corresponds to the experiment of taking out the garbage first in Experiment 2

# Priority(2).py  This file corresponds to Experiment 2's priority charging experiment

#  Priority_comparison_result.py Region_Segmentation_result.py    
The code of these two files is used to draw the graph and calculate the feature quantity for each experiment

# runAllExperiments.py    This file contains the code to run the experiment a certain number of times
